A Jupyter notebook consists of code cells that contain code that can be executed, and text cells that are used for documetation purposes. Jupyter notebooks are powered by an engine, in our case Python, that can be on your machine (local runtime) or hosted on a remote, cloud-based machine (hosted runtime). The instructions in each lab will assume that you are using Google Colab, but you should be able to use other runtimes too. If you choose other runtimes you might need to do some minor tweaks, such as installing a library that is provided by the Google Colab environment by default.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0fU6vnTkz9X6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Introductory Instructions about handling **Text block** and **Code block** in Python:\n","\n","Click on this text, and cell that contains it will be highlighted.
