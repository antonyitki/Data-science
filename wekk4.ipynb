To build and deploy a machine learning solution, our data science computing environment needs to be able to represent our data and has to provide **methods** to manipulate and process that data. Specifically, our data science environment needs to be able to efficiently represent and process **datasets**, i.e. collections of items described by a set of attributes.\n","\n","In this lab, we will explore different options to represent data and datasets in Python. We will refer to them as data types. In addition to the basic built-in types, we will discuss data types defined by two third-party specialised libraries, namely **NumPy** and **Pandas**.\n","\n","In this lab, we have explored several options to represent data and datasets in Python, including:\n","- Basic numeric, boolean and string types\n","- Standard lists\n","- Numpy arrays\n","- Pandas Series and DataFrames\n","\n","In general, NumPy arrays will be our preferred choice to represent complex data on a grid (such as time series and pictures) and homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes are of the same type. Pandas dataframes will be useful to represent heterogeneous datasets, where different attributes can have different types. There are additional subtleties, which you will learn as you develop your machine learning skills.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IQFyW-jnEKlu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Basic data types: Numeric\n","\n","Let's start considering two Python **numeric** types, namely ```int``` (for integer numbers) and ```float``` (for real numbers). Numeric types can be used to represent measurements and other quantities, and support operations such as addition (```+```), subtraction (```-```), multiplication (```*```) and division (```/```), among others. Run the following cell to perform some simple calculation on numeric variables."],"metadata":{"id":"i8iw8JkWM2cI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Sequence types\n","\n","The string type is a Python sequence. Sequences are ordered collections and can be used to represent a **complex attribute** (such as text), an **item** described by several attributes or even a **whole dataset**. As we shall see later, there are other options that might be more suitable to represent complex attributes and whole datasets, however it is important to be familiar with sequences. \n","\n","In addition to strings, Python offers other sequence types. We will cover Python **lists** here. Lists are defined as elements separated by commas between square brackets and can **indexed** and **sliced**: \n","- Indexing retrieves one element in a list. Given a list `s`, the `i`-th element can be retrived by typing `s[i]`. Note that the index of the first element in a list is 0. \n","- Slicing returns a subset of elements from the list. Typing `s[i:j:k]` returns a list of elements starting from index `i` to `j` (excluding `j`) with step `k`.\n","\n","The following code cell illustrates indexing and slicing."],"metadata":{"id":"BFSH2pBeNGjG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Numpy\n","During Week-1 and Week-2 Labs you have used NumPy Library.\n","\n","NumPy is the fundamental Python library for numerical computing. \n","\n","The core of NumPy is the `ndarray`, a **multidimensional array** (grid of values) that comes with a set of efficiently implemented array operations. Each dimension in an `ndarray` is known as axis. A 1D NumPy array has one axis and represents a vector, a 2D NumPy array has two axis and represents a matrix, a 3D NumPy array represents a 3-tensor, etc.\n","\n","In order to use NumPy, we need to import it first."],"metadata":{"id":"OvsbT2X0N_F8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Importing Library: Numpy"],"metadata":{"id":"B7CKNVv_Opeu"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DHLkIo7xEHcz"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","In contrast to standard Python lists, NumPy arrays have a **fixed size** at creation and their elements need to be of the **same type**.
